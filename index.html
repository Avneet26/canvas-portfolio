            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there!👋 I'm Avneet Singh Virdi, a Web Developer based in Toronto, Canada. I've been learing web development for over five years, and working professionally for almost 2 years, first as a Intern Full Stack Web Developer and then in a fast-paced startup in India. Now, I'm pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Information Technology Solutions at Humber College, Toronto, to further enhance my skills.</p>

            <p>Let me take you through my journey into programming. It all started back in 11th grade when I was introduced to C++. While it was interesting at first, things got a bit tricky once pointers entered the picture. However, during my Bachelor's studies, I discovered Java, which made more sense to me. Learning about Object-Oriented Programming reignited my passion for coding. Then, I dived into a Web developer bootcamp on Udemy, and that's when everything clicked. I found myself drawn to the creative side of Frontend development.</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding 🧑‍💻 or making assignments, you'll likely find me hitting the gym 🏋️ or unwinding with some games🎮.</p>
